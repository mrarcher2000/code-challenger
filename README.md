## Description

Learn to code through fun and friendly competition. Most code learning platforms are either lonely or harsh on newbies, but not the Code Challenger! The Code Challenger is a fun and engaging social media platform that encourages new Bootcamp graduates, college graduates, or lone wolfs alike to improve their coding abilities and share your progress with others. Invite your friends to play the Daily Challenge and see who can get the highest score. Earn yourself bragging rights and share your highscores with friends for a chance to climb your way onto the Leadboard.

To start improving your code with friends, go to https://code-challenger-archdev.herokuapp.com/.

Once you are signed up and logged in, go to the Daily Challenges page to see the day's coding challenge and try to complete the challenge quickly and with the least lines of code possible! Once you're done, run the code and you will be taken to the Leaderboard to see where you rank and how you did against other players! The Leaderboard will also show you who has the most combined points and who has completed the most challenges to date. Come back daily to complete the Daily Challenge and you may see yourself on there as well! Finally, go to the Activity page to see your feed of who is completing challenges and how they faired against the Daily Challenge that day!
